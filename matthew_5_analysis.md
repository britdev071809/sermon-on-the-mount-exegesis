## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Matthew 5:38
*Placeholder for exegesis.*

### Matthew 5:39
**Text:** "But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."

#### Historical‑Cultural Context
1. **The Slap as an Insult:** In the honor‑shame culture of first‑century Palestine, a slap was not merely an act of physical violence but a calculated insult meant to demean and dishonor the recipient. A backhanded slap with the right hand (the dominant hand for most people) landing on the *right* cheek of the victim was especially degrading, as it implied the slapper viewed the other as an inferior—a subordinate, a slave, or a social inferior.

2. **Why the Right Cheek?** Jesus’ specification of the *right* cheek suggests he is picturing a backhanded strike. In a right‑hand‑dominant society, a backhanded blow with the right hand naturally lands on the victim’s right cheek. By turning the *other* (left) cheek, the victim presents a cheek that can only be struck with an open‑handed slap or a fist—a blow that, in that culture, acknowledged the other as a peer. Thus, “turning the other cheek” is not passive submission but a non‑violent act of defiance that exposes the injustice of the aggressor and claims the victim’s own dignity.

3. **Non‑Violent Resistance:** Scholars such as Walter Wink have argued that Jesus’ command is a form of “moral jiu‑jitsu.” By refusing to retaliate in kind *and* by offering the other cheek, the victim robs the oppressor of the power to humiliate. The action says, in effect, “You cannot degrade me; I remain a human being worthy of respect.” This subverts the expected response of either cowering or striking back, and it places the aggressor in a moral dilemma.

#### Linguistic Notes
- The Greek verb ἀντιστῆναι (*anthistēnai*) means “to resist, oppose, stand against.” Jesus’ prohibition (“do not resist”) does not forbid all opposition but rather forbids resisting *with the same means*—i.e., repaying evil with evil.
- The phrase “turn the other cheek” (στρέψον αὐτῷ καὶ τὴν ἄλλην) uses the imperative of στρέφω, which implies a deliberate, conscious turning. It is an active, willful choice, not an involuntary reflex.

#### Theological Interpretation
1. **Reinterpretation of *Lex Talionis*:** In the preceding verse (5:38), Jesus cites the ancient principle of “an eye for an eye.” His teaching in 5:39 radically transposes that principle from a rule of proportionate retaliation to a call for non‑retaliation and creative, non‑violent resistance. The kingdom of God operates by a different logic: overcoming evil with good (cf. Romans 12:21).

2. **Love of Enemies:** This verse is a concrete illustration of the command to love one’s enemies (Matthew 5:44). By turning the other cheek, the disciple refuses to perpetuate the cycle of violence and instead opens a space for reconciliation—or at least exposes the evil for what it is.

3. **Imitatio Christi:** Jesus himself embodied this teaching during his passion (cf. Matthew 26:67; John 18:22–23). He did not retaliate when struck, yet he continued to speak truth to power.

#### Practical Application
- **In Personal Conflicts:** Turning the other cheek does not mean tolerating abuse; it means responding to insult in a way that asserts one’s humanity without mirroring the aggressor’s violence.
- **In Social Justice:** The principle has inspired many non‑violent resistance movements (e.g., Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi). It offers a strategy for confronting systemic injustice without adopting the methods of the oppressor.
- **Spiritual Discipline:** The practice cultivates humility, patience, and trust in God’s ultimate justice, rather than taking vengeance into one’s own hands.
