# Sermon on the Mount Exegesis Project

## Project Overview
This digital humanities project aims to provide a detailed, verse-by-verse exegesis of the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7). The analysis will incorporate historical, cultural, linguistic, and theological perspectives, with a focus on scholarly rigor and transparent methodology.

## Methodology
1. **Verse Selection**: Each verse will be analyzed individually, starting with Matthew 5:38-42 ("An Eye for an Eye").
2. **Research Workflow**: Using GitHub Issues to track research questions and tasks.
3. **Collaborative Analysis**: Development branches for each verse, with pull requests for peer review.
4. **Version Control**: All changes tracked via Git to maintain a clear history of scholarly contributions.

## Current Focus
- **Matthew 5:39**: "But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also."
